What is the maximum height of the game in pixels?
    - there must be a ceiling, even if there isn't a platform high enough for 
    the player to hit it

Should we use clear sprites when colored that way?

does inky lose if he jumps over the exit (do the sprites need to collide?)

do we want to have a password to get to levels
    how many levels are we making?
    can you skip the tutorial?
