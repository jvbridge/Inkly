This is the documentation of how menus and the manager works

Screen:

    Arguments:

    alwaysDraw
        boolean that sets the alwaysDraw boolean in the object
        
    alwaysUpdate
        boolean that sets the alwaysUpdate boolean in the object
        
    Properties:
    
    alwaysDraw
        Boolean that if true means the screen will always draw even when it is
        not the screen that the player can see. If false the screen only
        draws when it is on top. 
    
    alwaysUpdate
        Boolean that if true means the screen will always update even when it
        is not hte screen that the player can see. If false the screen only
        updates when it is on top. 
    
    initialized
        Boolean that is initially false. Set to true when screen has had its
        init() function called.
    
    Stage
        Sprite used for each of the screens. 
    
    Functions:
    
    init()
        Empty initialize function that is called when screen is first made.
        Should be overridden for each screen with a new function. 

Screen Manager:
    The screen manager is an object that contains a list of all screens, and
    determines which screen is on top and how they're updated. The name of the
    screen manager used in Inkly is screenManager. ScreenManager.prototype is
    a sprite used so that the ScreenManager class can have all the proterties 
    of a sprite.
    
    Objects:
    
    screens
        A list containing all screens the game has.
    
    Functions:
    draw()
        a loop that iterates over every screen in the list and calls their 
        draw() function if the screen's alwaysDraw boolean is true or if 
        they're the last screen in the list. This function is auto called, so 
        it shouldn't be called anywhere in InklyMain.js.
    
    update()
        a loop that iterates over every screen in the list and calls their
        update() function if the screens alwaysUpdate boolean is true or if
        they're the last screen in the list.
        
    push(screen)
        pushes the screen onto the list after calling the list's remove
        function on the screen to insure there are no duplicates
    
    pop()
        sets the screen's visibility to false and uses the lists pop() function
        on the tail of the list
    
    remove(screen)
        sets the screen's visibility to false as well as call's the list's 
        remove() function on the screen.
