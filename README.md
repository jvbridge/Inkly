At this present time I've assumed a resolution of 680x480 if that proves to be
insufficient we can up the size.

Inkly.html:
This is the main HTML file used for running the Inkly game. The game should 
run fine from here if this file is dropped into a web browser with all 
applicable assets

InklyMain.js:
This is the main JavaScript file. The game will only use this file unless we 
find the need for more. Using multiple files in JavaScript usually is not
necessary

Contents of InklyMain.js:
	1) initialize 2D and game
	2) set controls for the game
	3) Set up screen managers
	4) coming soon.....

brine.js:
This is the engine for the game 

Bugs: N/A
